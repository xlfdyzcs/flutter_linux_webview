# flutter_linux_webview v0.1.0 plugin Overview

This package provides the Linux Desktop implementation of `webview_flutter` (v3.0.4).

[webview_flutter v3.0.4](https://pub.dev/packages/webview_flutter/versions/3.0.4) is a [federated package](https://docs.flutter.dev/packages-and-plugins/developing-packages#federated-plugins), consisting of an app-facing package, platform interface package, and platform packages.

This plugin package provides the platform part for Linux.

## How a WebView user uses the platform implementation

When users create a [WebView](https://pub.dev/documentation/webview_flutter/3.0.4/webview_flutter/WebView-class.html) widget in their app, they can obtain a [WebViewController](https://pub.dev/documentation/webview_flutter/3.0.4/webview_flutter/WebViewController-class.html) through the `WebView.onWebViewCreated` callback, which they can use to manipulate the WebView.

The `WebViewController` delegates platform-specific operations to [its private member](https://github.com/flutter/plugins/blob/webview_flutter-v3.0.4/packages/webview_flutter/webview_flutter/lib/src/webview.dart#L505) of the [WebViewPlatformController](https://github.com/flutter/plugins/blob/webview_flutter-v3.0.4/packages/webview_flutter/webview_flutter_platform_interface/lib/src/platform_interface/webview_platform_controller.dart#L18) type.

On Linux, this member is an instance of `WebViewLinuxPlatformController`, which extends `WebViewPlatformController`.

Therefore, the `WebViewController` delegates operations to the `WebViewLinuxPlatformController`, which is provided in this package. `WebViewLinuxPlatformController` also invokes the native implementation.

It can be represented using the following diagram:

```
A WebView User ---uses---> WebViewController ---delegates---> WebViewLinuxPlatformController ---invokes---> native implementation (C++/CEF)
```

See `/example` or `../README.md` for examples of using a WebView widget and WebViewController.

### FYI: How the platform implementation is set in WebViewController

1. The user sets `LinuxWebView()` to the `WebView.platform` property.
  * where `LinuxWebView` implements `WebViewPlatform`.
1. The user creates a `WebView` widget in the app.
  * (Before this point, the user must call `LinuxWebViewPlugin.initialize()` (located in `lib/src/linux_webview_plugin.dart`) in advance to start CEF.)
1. In `_WebViewState.build()`, `WebView.platform.build()`, that is, `LinuxWebView.build()` is called.
  * Here [_WebViewState._onWebViewPlatformCreated()](https://github.com/flutter/plugins/blob/webview_flutter-v3.0.4/packages/webview_flutter/webview_flutter/lib/src/webview.dart#L342) is passed to `LinuxWebView.build()` as a callback.
1. `LinuxWebView.build()` returns `WebViewLinuxWidget`.
1. `WebViewLinuxWidget.initState()` is called by the Flutter Framework.
1. In `WebViewLinuxWidget.initState()`, `WebViewLinuxPlatformController` (extends `WebViewPlatformController`) is asynchronously initialized.
1. After initializing `WebViewLinuxPlatformController`, The `WebViewLinuxWidget` returns it to the given `onWebViewPlatformCreated` callback, that is, `_WebViewState._onWebViewPlatformCreated()`.
1. `_WebViewState._onWebViewPlatformCreated()` takes the `WebViewLinuxPlatformController`, creates a `WebViewController` with it, and passes the `WebViewController` to the `WebView.onWebViewCreated` callback.
1. The user obtains the `WebViewController` through the `WebView.onWebViewCreated` callback.
  * This `WebViewController` delegates operations to `WebViewLinuxPlatformController`.

## The Native Plugin Implementation (C++/CEF)

The native implementation of the plugin uses CEF (Chromium Embedded Framework) as the underlying browser (see `../README.md` for the version of CEF) and consists of three main parts:

* `FlutterLinuxWebviewPlugin`
  * The base part of the plugin. It handles the initialization and termination of the plugin, and is the connection point between the Dart-side method calls and `FlutterWebviewController`.
* `FlutterWebviewController`
  * It provides the API to control a WebView, wrapping the CEF API.
* `FlutterWebviewHandler`
  * It defines the behavior of a WebView.

### Initialization, method calls, termination, and the threads

* The native plugin runs on the platform thread, which is the same thread on which the Flutter Engine runs.
* When the Flutter application starts, `flutter_linux_webview_plugin_register_with_registrar()` located in `flutter_linux_webview_plugin.cc` is called to initialize this plugin.
* Once the plugin is initialized, method calls from the Dart side come to `method_call_cb()` and are handled by `flutter_linux_webview_plugin_handle_method_call()`.
* A user explicitly calls `LinuxWebViewPlugin.initialize()` (located in `lib/src/linux_webview_plugin.dart`) to start CEF before creating the first WebView.
  * `LinuxWebViewPlugin.initialize()` invokes `FlutterWebviewController::StartCef()` on the native side.
  * `FlutterWebviewController::StartCef()` creates and starts a new thread, the CEF UI thread, whose entry point is `FlutterWebviewController::CefMainThread()`.
  * `FlutterWebviewController::CefMainThread()` calls `CefInitialize()` and `CefRunMessageLoop()`, which starts CEF. (The thread is blocked by the message loop.)
* `FlutterWebviewController` methods except `StartCef()` and `ShutdownCef()` must be executed in the CEF UI thread.
* (**Prior to Flutter 3.10**) When the plugin object is destroyed, that is, when the application exits, `flutter_linux_webview_plugin_class_finalize()` is called, which calls `FlutterWebviewController::ShutdownCef()`.
* (**Flutter 3.10 or later (as of 3.13)**) The user explicitly calls `LinuxWebViewPlugin.terminate()` when the application exits. It invokes `FlutterWebviewController::ShutdownCef()` on the native side.
  * In Flutter 3.10, [WidgetsBindingObserver.didRequestAppExit](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/WidgetsBindingObserver/didRequestAppExit.html) API has been added. However, as a side effect of that change, it no longer calls the `flutter_linux_webview_plugin_class_finalize()/_dispose()`. So we need to have users explicitly call `LinuxWebViewPlugin.terminate()`.
    * ref. https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/121378 + https://github.com/flutter/engine/pull/40033#discussion_r1200216166
* `FlutterWebviewController::ShutdownCef()` requests all running browsers to exit and waits for all browsers and the CEF UI thread to exit.

### Separate executables layout

CEF runs using a browser process and sub-processes. This plugin executes the browser using the separate sub-process executable layout (ref. https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/cef/wiki/GeneralUsage#markdown-header-separate-sub-process-executable).

The sub-process executable is built with the name `flutter_webview_subprocess`, bundled with the Flutter app, and launched as needed.

The source files for the sub-process executable are located in `linux/subprocess/`.

```


## The build process for the plugin

The build process is described in `linux/CMakeLists.txt` and is outlined below.

First of all, this directory (`linux/`) is added using `add_subdirectory()` during the build configuration of the Flutter Linux app project.

1. Verifies that the string `include(flutter/ephemeral/.plugin_symlinks/flutter_linux_webview/linux/cmake/link_to_cef_library.cmake)` is included in the `CMakeLists.txt` of the app project. If it is not included, adds the string to the end of that file and shows a message to prompt the user to rebuild the app.
  - `linux/cmake/link_to_cef_library.cmake` contains a `target_link_libraries()` command for linking to `libcef.so`.
  - This setting is necessary because the plugin will hang in the `CefInitialize()` function if the Flutter app executable is not linked to `libcef.so`.
2. Downloads and extracts the CEF binary distribution (cef_binary_130.1.2+g48f3ef6+chromium-130.0.6723.44_linux64_minimal) in the `linux/` directory.
3. Modifies the CEF binary distribution to prepare for building the sub-process executable.
  - Applies `linux/subprocess/cef_distrib_patch/build_flutter_webview_subprocess.patch` to `linux/<CEF binary distrib dir>/CMakeLists.txt` to enable building for the `linux/subprocess/src/`.
4. The plugin (`libflutter_linux_webview.so` and `flutter_webview_subprocess`) is built under the `<Flutter app build dir>/plugins/flutter_linux_webview/` directory.
5. CEF binary files, CEF resource files, and the sub-process executable are bundled in `<Flutter app build dir>/bundle/lib`.
